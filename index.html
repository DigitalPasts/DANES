            The conference wishes to bring together international scholars from historical, archaeological, philological, and computational disciplines studying the ancient Near East. One of the main aims of this gathering is to establish a collaborative research network for the application of computational and quantitative methods to the study of the cuneiform cultures from greater Mesopotamia to the eastern Mediterranean. The definition of cuneiform cultures in this context is as broad as possible, including all peoples who wrote in cuneiform from the Sumerians to the Persians.<br />

            The conference will focus on cuneiform literature and its different manifestations in art and material culture. However, translating literary and historical analyses of cuneiform cultures into computational methods is more than mere machine coding of critical thinking about ancient texts and artefacts. Computational and quantitative analysis with methods such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, machine learning, knowledge graphs, and computer vision, requires new ways of constructing and producing meaning from already established philological and historiographical methods.<br />
